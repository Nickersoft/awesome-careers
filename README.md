## Full-Stack Web Developer

### Overview

A full-stack web developer is a web developer or engineer who works with both the front and back ends of a website or application—meaning they can tackle projects that involve databases, building user-facing websites, or even work with clients during the planning phase of projects.

Full-stack web developers:

- **Code** in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one or more back end languages.
- **Specialize** in a particular back end programming language, like Ruby or PHP or Python, although some, especially if they’ve been working as a developer for a while, work with more than one.
- **Build** web solutions end-to-end. Startups often lust after full-stack engineers, as they can often carry the majority of the implementation for modern web platforms.

# Design

## UX/UI Designer

### Overview

UI (user interface) designers are responsible for presenting a product's development in a way that is attractive and convenient for users,
while UX (user experience) designers are responsible for enhancing customer satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure associated with a product in a way that is attractive and convenient for users.
Often used interchangable, UI design and UX design are two separate but very closely related fields. I've grouped the two under this single section for this exact reason. Typically, most designers rely on user interfaces to
improve the user experience, so the two fields often go hand-in-hand.

Typically, UX/UI designers:

- **Iterate** over numerous designs and wireframes before landing on an ideal design that most strongly resonates with users.
- **Prototype** their designs to illustrate the intended interactions using tools such as Figma, Invision, SwiftUI or React.
- **Collaborate** with engineers and PMs to weigh product requirements and technical limitations to produce the most workable design.

According to Glassdoor, the base pay for a UX/UI designer is **~\$100,000/yr**.
